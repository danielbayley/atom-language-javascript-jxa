# [JavaScript for Automation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/Articles/Introduction.html) ("JXA") language support in [Atom](https://atom.io)

Now you can use Atom instead of Apple's shitty Script Editor!

## Install
`apm install language-jxa` or search "jxa" under packages within Atom.

Plays nice with [atom-script](https://github.com/rgbkrk/atom-script) (`apm install script`) to run your code directly (good riddance Script Editorâ€¦)
